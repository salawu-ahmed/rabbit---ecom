This is a note of the things I have learnt while building this project.
It includes explanations, discoveries, things I plan to do while building this project or after building this project.


#### Lorem For Images
One of the most useful things I have discovered building this project is the https://picsum.photos website. This is a website that provides you with image placeholders when building a project. This is so cool because I dont have to manually download images when developing. It allows me to focus on implementation rather the aesthetic. 

#### Real Use-case for Refs
In building this project I have come see how a ref can be used in an actual project . The most sterling example is when building the cart drawer component. 

#### Creating mock data 
I have learnt to use useEffect hook to create mock data when building. This is especially helpful because I dont necessarily have to create the backend before I can progress on the frontend. Using useEffect and mock data to mimic receiving a response from the backend allows me to concentrate on the frontend solely before moving to the backend. This is particularly useful because as a solo developer switching from backend to frontend back and forth can easily be distracting and overwhelming. This new technique learnt helps with separation of concerns for me soo much.

#### Building Forms.
Building forms can sometimes be tricky for me. In this project I have learnt to stick to a simple approach of using divs to wrap form elements and to not shy away from using grid to simply align elements. Flexbox is not the holy grail. I can use a grid for just two columns. It doesnt have to always be flexbox.

#### Designing Schemas
From this tutorial I have learnt an approach to designing my schemas. For example at the 08:06h mark 
he presents a table for the schema of the products. I like how I am able to see all the details of the product schema without having to write any code. I think this is brilliant. The table presented the attribute of the model, the type of the attribute ie string, number or enums. then the table shows whether it is mandatory or optional or any other thing that needs to be done.

#### Designing routes
I really like how he approach creating the routes for the product model as well. he first list 
all the routes he has to create. I think this is incredible. It helps put the backend into perspective.

## Todos
#### Dates 
I have realised that working with dates is going to be a common thing when working with appplications hence I am going to spend sometime reading on the javascript date object and build a few projects around it.

#### URLParameters
Working with parameters and routing is something I will have to work on as well. I will spend time reading and working with url parameters and routing. Also I will work with the web api.

#### udemy react course 
I will briefly revisit my Udemy course on react so I can read NOT WATCH the topics and see how they play in this e-commerce project.

#### Global search 
Find out what global search is and implement it in the project

#### Confirmation Emails
Try implementing com=nfirmation emails in the project.

#### Reading 
Read more on the packages used in the project. Make simple notes on them for reference later on.
Nothing detailed, just simple notes on what they do and the key features
